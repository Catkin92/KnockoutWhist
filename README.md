# Knockout Whist
I started this project based on the card game Knockout Whist in late December as a way to explore game logic. The game is trick based, with one fewer cards being handed out each round.
I'm using https://deckofcardsapi.com/ for the deck, writing in Javascript using Vue as a framework.
